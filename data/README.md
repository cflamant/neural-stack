This folder contains validation data and test data.

The validation data val_x.txt and val_y.txt consists of 1000 integer sequences of length 8 to 64 (not including the special integers 0,1,2 which correspond to the start, separator, and terminal symbols respectively). This range of sequence lengths is the same as that of the training data these networks were trained on.

The test data test_x.txt and test_y.txt consist of 1000 integer sequences of length 65 to 128. This will show how well the training generalized to reversing sequences of longer length.
